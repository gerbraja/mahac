notes: |
  This is a cleaned YAML template for the "Millionaire Binary" plan. The original
  file contained non-YAML content (React, Python, and docs) which has been moved to
  a backup file named `plan_template_backup_raw.txt` in this directory. Edit numeric
  values and thresholds here. Amounts should be stored as strings (e.g. "0.50") so
  they validate cleanly as Decimal values in the backend.
