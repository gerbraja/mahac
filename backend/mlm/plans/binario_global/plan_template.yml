notes: |
	This YAML defines the Binary Global (2x2) plan. Rules:
	- All users who pre-register (provide first_name, last_name, email, city and country) are placed into the binary 2x2 structure and keep their position for up to 90 days.
	- If they do not purchase the activation package within 90 days they are removed from the network (remove_if_not_activated).
	- When a user activates by buying the activation package, they are eligible to receive arrival bonuses for users who entered after them, regardless of whether those users have activated.
	- Arrival bonus rules are defined under `arrival_bonus`. Amounts are strings and will be parsed to Decimal.

	- Commission on activation packages: `signup_package_commission_percent` (above) defines the percent of the package value allocated to the plan's distribution. For Binary Global this is 7% by default.
